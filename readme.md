# **INTRODUCTION**

Click a slot and then double click a name on the left to add them to the slot
team should be organized the same as how it is ingame

Sprint Mile Medium Long Dirt

Sprint Mile Medium Long Dirt

Sprint Mile Medium Long Dirt

Click a portrait and then enter their score and click the enter button to enter their score into their scorelist

The program will automatically track their average score and the highest averages of your team

**NOTE** THIS PROGRAM WILL (PROBABLY) ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS MACHINES ON 1920x1080 DISPLAYS WHILE IN FULLSCREEN

# **7/26 Update**

OCR has been added

There is now a button to add scores using OCR

To use it, simply click the button, and then scroll up and down the score list after a team trials

It should make a windows noise after collecting all scores

Click a portrait to update the scores, and all horses will have their scores added and their averages will be updated.

If it does not make a noise and it has been a long time, it probably didnt work, so just press the button and try again.

(It only saves scores if all 15 scores have been successfully determined)

# **REQUIREMENTS**

Python 3 (idk which version exactly, i programmed it using 3.13.5 though)

You need to download the Tesseract open source OCR engine, which can be downloaded here https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki


# **NOTES**

This is essentially my first program ever,  I made it  as a personal project because I didnt want to keep updating a google sheet

As such, I have basically no clue over proper / good programming practices

Everything in here was just the best way that I could come up with to solve problems

It is only configured to work on windows on 1920x1080 displays on fullscreen

The act of fixing this seemed too arduous for a program that I only planned on using personally and didnt intend initially to upload to github

However, I will update this as new characters are added or if I feel like I wish to add something

The program is probably liable to explode sometimes, I don't entirely understand how to make sure things run on systems other than mine

I also had a lot of issues with the system path and using pyinstaller, so that might be responsible for breaking everything

for what its worth, it worked on my laptop after uploading it onto discord from my main pc.
